The following code crafting tools are (or will be) available on
`GitHub`_:

.. _Chierps:

Chierps
  Component-based hierarchic programming system.  This is a framework
  for building software by implementing and connecting message-passing
  components.  The interfaces and hierarchic descriptions for
  components are defined using `Pidgen`_.  The Chierps framework
  provides a messaging system implementation and tools to generate
  interface code from the component descriptions.

.. _Pidgen:

Pidgen
  Language for defining software component messaging interfaces and
  hierarchic component implementations.  The message content is
  defined using `Tydl`_.

.. _Tydl:

Tydl
  Type definition language.  This language is used to define the
  content of messages sent between software or hardware components.
  Type definitions can be used to generate documentation or high-level
  code for manipulating messages in various programming languages.
  
.. _Wumps:

`Wumps <Wumps-site_>`_
  Widely useful macro programming syntax.  This general-purpose syntax
  is a foundation for building domain-specific languages such as
  `Tydl`_ and `Pidgen`_.
