Goals
=====

In the Code Craftsmen's view, writing software is currently much more
difficult than it needs to be.  Our hope, and our primary goal, is to
**restore the joy in programming** by developing code crafting tools
that make software:

- Easier to read
- Easier to write
- Easier to maintain
- Easier to reuse

Principles
==========

There are a few key principles that support these goals and drive our
design strategy, such as:

- `Don't repeat yourself`_
- Design for testability
- Documentation is important
- Don't repeat yourself (unless it's worth saying twice)

Although there are surely some other principles worth adding to this
list, the ones listed here play a major role in many of our design
decisions.
