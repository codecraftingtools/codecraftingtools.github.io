Code craftsmen believe that great software is not merely the result of
sound computing theory, good engineering practices, and technical
knowledge.  The creation of truly great software also requires
ingenuity, a sense of aesthetics, intuition, experience, skill, and
patience.  In this regard, writing code is more of a craft than an art
or a science.  The result of this craft should be something that is
both useful and beautiful in its design, like a piece of fine

  The craftsman also realizes that, with very few exceptions, a computer
  program is never really finished.  Much like a living entity (or a
  home), a program often evolves to meet new requirements, overcome
  limitations, change undesirable behavior, and remain fashionable.

  Like a gardener, the programmer prunes and directs the growth of a

  All too often, the source code of a program is regarded as simply a
  means to an end.  While this may be true to a degree, a code craftsman
  knows that in practice, the design, structure, and beauty of source
  code have a great effect on the end product.  A well-crafted product
  is a joy to use.

  Aside from any arguments, the code craftsman desires to write
  beautiful code for beauty's sake, if nothing else.
