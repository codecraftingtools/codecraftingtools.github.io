If the Code Craftsmen have produced anything useful, we realize that
this is only possible because we are `standing on the shoulders of
giants`_.  Software is not created in a vacuum: each piece is built on
the code and ideas that have come before it.  The following external
software projects serve as a foundation for our :ref:`code crafting
tools<code crafting tools>`.  Although this list is by no means
exhaustive, it serves as an overview of the software dependencies and
provides links to relevant local and upstream documentation.
