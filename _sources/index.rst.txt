Philosophy
==========

Code craftsmen believe that good computer software is not merely the
result of sound computing theory, good engineering practices, and
technical knowledge.  It also requires ingenuity, a sense of
aesthetics, intuition, experience, and skill.  In this regard, writing
code is more of a craft than an art or a science.  The result of this
craft should be something that is both useful and beautiful in its
design.
