  Summary
  =======

  Tools for crafting quality software
  -----------------------------------
  
- Design reusable software components that send and receive messages
- Describe message structures using a powerful type definition
  language
- Implement primitive components in C++ or Python
- Instantiate primitive components and connect them together to build
  component hierarchies
- Automatically generate configurable applications from component
  hierarchies or write a customized main program
- Develop multi-threaded real-time systems, simulations, or desktop
  applications
- Utilize the same components in any supported run-time environment,
  or in an object-oriented manner
- Generate developer and user documentation directly from component
  interface definitions
