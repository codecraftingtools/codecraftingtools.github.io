If the Code Craftsmen have produced anything useful, we realize that
this is only possible because we are `standing on the shoulders of
giants`_.  Software is not created in a vacuum: each piece is built on
the code and ideas that have come before it.  The following list
describes the software utilized by one or more of our :ref:`code
crafting tools<tools>`.  Although this list is by no means exhaustive,
it serves as an overview of the software dependencies and provides
links to relevant documentation.
