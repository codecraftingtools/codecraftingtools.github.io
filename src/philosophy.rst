Philosophy
==========

The Code Craftsmen believe that great software is not merely the
result of well-defined software requirements, sound computing theory,
and good engineering practice.  The creation of truly great software
also requires a clear overarching vision, a sense of aesthetics, a bit
of ingenuity and intuition, and a good measure of experience, skill,
and patience.  In this regard, writing code is really more of a craft
than an art, a science, or an engineering discipline.  The result of
this craft should be something that is both useful and beautiful in
its design, like a piece of fine furniture, a quality hand tool, or a
handcrafted guitar.

  The craftsman also realizes that, with very few exceptions, a computer
  program is never really finished.  Much like a living entity (or a
  home), a program often evolves to meet new requirements, overcome
  limitations, change undesirable behavior, and remain fashionable.

  All too often, the source code of a program is regarded as simply a
  means to an end.  While this may be true to a degree, a code
  craftsman observes that in practice, the design, structure, and
  readability (beauty?) of source code have a positive (great?) effect
  on the end product.  A well-crafted product is a joy to use.
