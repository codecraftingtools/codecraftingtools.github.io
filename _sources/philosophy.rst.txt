Code craftsmen believe that great software is not merely the result of
sound computing theory, good engineering practices, and technical
knowledge.  The creation of truly great software also requires an
overarching vision and sense of aesthetics, a little ingenuity and
intuition, and a good measure of experience, skill, and patience.  In
this regard, writing code is really more of a craft than an art or a
science.  The result of this craft should be something that is both
useful and beautiful in its design, like a piece of fine furniture, a
well-balanced knife, or a handcrafted guitar.

  The craftsman also realizes that, with very few exceptions, a computer
  program is never really finished.  Much like a living entity (or a
  home), a program often evolves to meet new requirements, overcome
  limitations, change undesirable behavior, and remain fashionable.

  Like a gardener, the programmer prunes and directs the growth of a
  code base to maintain its beauty.

  All too often, the source code of a program is regarded as simply a
  means to an end.  While this may be true to a degree, a code craftsman
  knows that in practice, the design, structure, and beauty of source
  code have a great effect on the end product.  A well-crafted product
  is a joy to use.

  Aside from any arguments, the code craftsman desires to write
  beautiful code for beauty's sake, if nothing else.
