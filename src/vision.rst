The Code Craftsmen endeavour to provide a suite of tools that enables
software developers to design reusable software components that can be
combined in a hierarchic fashion to form complex applications with
minimal effort.

In order to achieve this goal, our software components interact with
their run-time environment using a standardized, non-blocking,
event-driven interface and communicate with one another by sending and
receiving messages through this interface.  This approach allows the
same components to be used in a wide variety of contexts, from
multi-threaded real-time environments to single-threaded desktop
applications.  Common operations, such as component configuration,
initialization, and termination are also standardized as much as
possible to facilitate the development of generalized application
executives that can automatically handle these functions.

The component interfaces, message content, and hierarchic application
structure are defined in a rich, extensible format that consolidates
all of the relevant metadata in one location.  This metadata can then
be leveraged by any number of tools to generate code and
documentation.
